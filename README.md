Midterm


My project is a maze game. when you start, you need to look for 5 sphere that can open the door. One of the sphere you click "f" to plant a barerl to reach one of the sphere. 
Once you passed through the door it's a maze where you would ned to find the places that contains lever. there are 3 levers to open a gate and you have to click the letter "e" to flip the lever.
each lever contains a chalenge that you must face and try to beat. 
once you find all the lever you can find the door that was open and walked straight through a door and you will complete the puzzle.


There are stuff that I use in outside source

1. The door and collecting items I saw it from a youtube video from this person. It taught me how to make a door that can open when you collected your items.

2.The game should tell you the objectives on what you need to do. I saw it from a youtube video. It would teach me how to make it pop out in front of the player screen witha trigger box.
